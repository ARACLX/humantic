Freelancing Platform that connects people with people and companies with people to make hiring right guns for right jobs
in few seconds, this platform aims to be (going through stereotypes) indie-free because personally I don't belive in
people who have 30 years of experience and can developer everything with 15 different programming languages.

> Humantic will launch potentially at Q1 2021, meanwhile I would like to recommend you [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/)

## About Humantic

### Story about Humantic

Founder of Araclx, [Jakub Olan](https://github.com/ZiQiLN) was an freelancer and know common issues on freelancing
platforms available on market (only Toptal works, but always when I was scheduling meeting there I didn't had time or
something, never gone through intial talk because I had no time), they are a bit out of whole idea, Freelancing is like
being a The Witcher irl, you're taking an offer, completing that on time, delivering proof and then going through your
way - that's an freelancing that I like, the idea is simple. In Humantic I would like to realize that maybe a bit wierd
idea about freelancing, basically I don't have money to buy bids on UpWork or something so I've decided to build my own.
